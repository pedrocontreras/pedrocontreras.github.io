### [Demo Website](http://ankitsultana.com/researcher)

A clean, single column, monospace resume template built for jekyll

### Installation

Simply fork the repository and edit away.

### Customization

* You can edit the `.md` (markdown) files as you see fit. You can also add some other markdown file, say `foo.md` in the root directory of the repository. It will then be accessible like so `{{ url of your website }}/foo`.

* You can of course remove `contact.md` if you don't want it

* To set the heading, edit the `title` variable in `_config.yml`

* To edit the `links` mentioned on the navigation bar, edit the file `_data/nav.yml`

* You can change the accent (color of hyperlinks) by editing the `accent` variable in `_sass/vars.scss`

* You can setup google analytics, by setting `tracking_id` in `_config.yml`
